# Double Pendulum Simulator
 This is Double Pendulum Simulation coded with Python
 The idea came from The Coding Train Chanllege 93, using angular acceleration to animate the motion of double pendulum.
 According to Google, Double Pendulum is commonly used in the study of chaotic and state transitions.
 This simulation simulate the 2D motion of Double Pendulum and it past moving track.
